### Copy, paste, and export Figma Variables into CSV format!
Simple plugin that copies and pastes variables between files. Copied variables can also be exported into a downloadable CSV file.  
[View in Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1519396399925531267/variable-copy-paste-export)

**HOW TO USE**:
- Open the plugin and hit "Copy Variables". The copied collections and modes should then appear in the plugin UI.
- Go to the file you want to paste to, open the plugin and hit "Paste".
- Double-check that the pasted variables match the original. Sometimes they get pasted out of order.
- Copied variables can also be exported by hitting "Export" and then clicking on the "Download CSV" link that appears underneath.

‚ö†Ô∏è **PLEASE NOTE: Aliases that reference external (non-local) variables will not work** and will be shown in the console if found.  
Also, pasted variables may not always end up in their original order- I am not a dev and don't know why this happens (if anyone can help, please do ü•≤)
